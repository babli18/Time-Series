    "## Question 1. (8 pts) \n",
    "The Bureau of Transportation Statistics (BTS) conducted a study to evaluate the impact of Sept 11 attacks (9/11) on U.S. air transportation. The purpose of this study is to provide a greater understanding of the passenger travel behavior patterns of persons travelling by air before and after the event. In order to assess the impact of September 11, BTS took the following approach: Using data before September 11, it forecasted future data (under the assumption of no terrorist attack). Then, BTS compared the forecasted series with the actual data to assess the impact of the event. \n",
